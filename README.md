<br/>

Writing a [Dash web application](https://github.com/plotly/dash) gives a lot of flexibility, however, it also requires :snake: Python knowledge from the person setting it up.

*Webviz* is a LGPL-licensed configuration layer on top of Dash, which encourages making reusable components and dashboards, which can then be added/removed when creating an application using a short [`yaml`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) configuration file.

**These are the main user groups targeted by *Webviz*:**
- **You do not know Python**, and only want to add different predefined dashboards or visualizations/components in a certain order and/or on different pages in the application. Optionally with some text and mathematical equations (that you provide) inbetween the  dashboards, explaining what the user is looking at.
- **You know [Python](https://www.python.org/)**, and want to create generic or specialized dashboards you or other users can reuse by simply asking for it in the Webviz configuration file. This can be done without knowing JavaScript (see also [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) for more information).
- **You know [React](https://reactjs.org/)**, and want to create highly specialized visualization which Python or pure config-file users can reuse.

*Webviz* will create web applications with very :lock: strict security headers and CSP settings, giving an rating of **A+** on e.g. [Mozilla observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/). It also facilitates a :whale: Docker setup, where the Python code can be ran completely unpriviliged in a sandbox (both with respect to file system access and network communication).

Example configuration file and information about the standard containers can be seen in [the documentation](https://equinor.github.io/webviz-config/).

**The workflow can be summarized as this:**
1) The user provides a :book: configuration file following the [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) standard.
2) *Webviz* reads the configuration file and automatically writes the corresponding :snake: Python code.
3) The created application can be viewed locally, or deployed using :whale: Docker to a cloud provider. Both out of the box.

### Installation

The simplest way of installing `webviz-config` is to run
```bash
pip install webviz-config
```

If you want to download the latest source code and install it manually you 
can run
```bash
git clone git@github.com:equinor/webviz-config.git
cd ./webviz-config
pip install .
```

### Usage

After installation, there is a console script named `webviz` available. You can test the installation by using the provided test
configuration file,
```bash
webviz build ./examples/basic_example.yaml
```

Without any additional arguments, this will
1) create a temporary folder
2) write the Python application code to that folder
3) start a localhost server

When stopping the server (press CTRL+C at any time), the temporary folder is deleted.

The optional arguments can be seen when running
```bash
webviz --help
```
For example will
```bash
webviz build ./examples/basic_example.yaml --portable ./my_portable_app
```
create a portable instance (with corresponding Dockerfile) and store it in the provided folder.

A feature in Dash is [hot reload](https://community.plot.ly/t/announcing-hot-reload/14177).
When the Dash Python code file is saved, the content seen in the web browser is
automatically reloaded (no need for localhost server restart). This feature is passed on to
the Webviz configuration utility, meaning that if the user runs 
```bash
webviz build ./examples/basic_example.yaml
```
and then modifies `./examples/basic_example.yaml` while the Webviz application is
still running, a hot reload will occur.

For quick local analysis, `webviz-config` uses `https` and runs on `localhost`.
In order to create your personal `https` certificate (only valid for `localhost`), run
```bash
webviz certificate --auto-install
```
Certificate installation guidelines will be given when running the command.

### Creating new containers

If you are interested in creating new containers which can be configured through
the configuration file, take a look at the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

To quickly get started, we recommend using the corresponding
[cookiecutter template](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-container-boilerplate).
